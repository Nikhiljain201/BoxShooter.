# BoxShooter.
A simple never ending game where you have to shoot boxes and collect points until the time runs out. There are 3 Boxes to shoot

White Box - increases time and Awards points
Yellow box - Decreases time
Green Box - Awards point

The boxes keep spawning after every second and you can see that random boxes will keep on spawning each and every time.

You can also make changes manually. For example if you want to make this as a level based game you can make it by changing some of the elements in the scene.
